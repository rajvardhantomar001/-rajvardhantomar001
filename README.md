I am interest in emerging technologies such as ChatGPT, LLMs, Generative AI, prompt engineering, blockchain, etc. Participating in Epilepsy research and serving as an ML Intern at Beyond Exams have significantly enhanced my comprehension of data sciences, data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. Additionally, I have a robust interest in mathematical modelling, mathematical visualization, and statistics.
